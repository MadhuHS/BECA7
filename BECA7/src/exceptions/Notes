Exception Handling

* Exception is an unexpected event which occurs at Runtime due to 
  unexpected operation performed by a single line of code

* Exception handling is writing code which will recover the program
  from the exception and continue the execution.

* Error is an unexpected event which occurs at Runtime due to
  hardware or software failure of the system.
  
* 1.When ever there is an exception JVM will create an 
  Object of corresponding exception class.

* 2.JVM will pass the exception object to the 
  method which created the exception by using throw keyword
  
* 3.If the method is not able to handle the exception object, then
  JVM will terminate the method's execution.

* 4.If no methods are handling the exception object then JVM will call
  Default Exception Handler which will handle the exception Object.
  
* 5.Default exception handler will handle the exception and prints
  - Name of the exception 
  - Reason for the exception
  - Complete stack Trace
