Data Structure : Arranging the data in a particular order to use 
                 them effeciently in the program.
                 
Data structurers are of 2 types

1. Linear DS
2. Hirarchical DS

1. Linear DS : A type of DS where data are arranged in a linear sequence.
               Arrays, Stack ,Queue,LinkedList

2. Hirarchical DS : A type of DS where data are arranged 
               according to some Relation
               Tree,Graphs
               
Object array : 
               It is a type of array where each and
               every bucket of the array represents
               one reference variable;.
               
               Within Object array we can store any type of Objects.
               (Due to Upcasting)
