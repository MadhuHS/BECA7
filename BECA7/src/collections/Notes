  
   Array                Collection

1. Fixed in size       1. Collection is growable in nature
                          Size of the collection can be increased
                          or decreased at the runtime.

2. NO built-in         2. Collection has built-in methods
   method support         to perform basic and advanced operations
                          on the group of data.   
                          
3. Don't have any      3. Every collection is built by using
   underlying DS          at least one DS
   
4. Supports only       4. By default supports hetrogeneous data
   homogeneous data   
  
 * Collection is a group of references which is represented as One unit.
 
 * Collection are of 3 types
   
   1. List
   2. Set
   3. Queue
   
   
   List type of Collection
   
   * List can store duplicates.
   * List has index.
   * List support multiple null values.
   * List preserve insertion order.
   
   
   ArrayList
   
   * ArrayList can store duplicates.
   * ArrayList has index.
   * ArrayList support multiple null values.
   * ArrayList preserve insertion order.
   
   * Resizable array is the underlying Data Structure of ArrayList.
   
   Constructors of ArrayList
   
   ArrayList()
   Constructs an empty list with an initial capacity of ten.
   
   ArrayList(int initialCapacity)
   Constructs an empty list with the specified initial capacity.
   
   ArrayList(Collection c)
   Constructs a list containing the elements 
   of the specified collection.
   
 
   
   Methods of ArrayList

   ..
   
   * ArrayList implementation is not synchronized. 
   * ArrayList is NOT THREAD SAFE.
   * If multiple threads access an ArrayList concurrently, 
     and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, 
     it will impact on other threads.
