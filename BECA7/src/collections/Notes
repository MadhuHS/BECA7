  
   Array                Collection

1. Fixed in size       1. Collection is growable in nature
                          Size of the collection can be increased
                          or decreased at the runtime.

2. NO built-in         2. Collection has built-in methods
   method support         to perform basic and advanced operations
                          on the group of data.   
                          
3. Don't have any      3. Every collection is built by using
   underlying DS          at least one DS
   
4. Supports only       4. By default supports hetrogeneous data
   homogeneous data   
  
 * Collection is a group of references which is represented as One unit.
 
 * Collection are of 3 types
   
   1. List
   2. Set
   3. Queue
   
   
   List type of Collection
   
   * List can store duplicates.
   * List has index.
   * List support multiple null values.
   * List preserve insertion order.
   
   
   ArrayList
   
   * ArrayList can store duplicates.
   * ArrayList has index.
   * ArrayList support multiple null values.

   Methods of ArrayList
   
   *
   *
   ..
   
   * ArrayList implementation is not synchronized.

     it will impact on other threads.

   * HashSet do not preserve insertion order.
   
   * Underlying Data Structure of HashSet is Hash Table.
   
   Iterator :
   
   * Iterator is cursor which is used to retrieve the element
     present in any given collection.
     
   * Iterator is created automatically whenever the collection
     object is created.
     
   * For every Collection separate iterator is created.
   
   * We can access the iterator of the given collection
     by calling iterator().
     
   * The iterator reference returned by the iterator()
     should be stored within a reference variable 
     of Iterator type.
    
   Load Factor : It is a threshold that decides when should be
                 the collection created based on elements added.
     
   Constructor of HashSet 
   HashSet()
   Constructs a new, empty set with
   initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).
   
   HashSet(Collection c)
   Constructs a new set containing the elements 
   in the specified collection.
   
   HashSet(int initialCapacity)
   Constructs a new, empty set with specified 
   initial capacity and default load factor (0.75).
   
   HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
   Constructs a new, empty set with the specified
   initial capacity and the specified load factor.
   
   * HashSet implementation is not synchronized. 
   * HashSet is NOT THREAD SAFE.
   * If multiple threads access an HashSet concurrently, 
     and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, 
     it will impact on other threads.
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   initial capacity and default load factor (0.75).
   
   LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
   Constructs a new, empty set with the specified
   initial capacity and the specified load factor.
   
   * LinkedHashSet implementation is not synchronized. 
   * LinkedHashSet is NOT THREAD SAFE.
   * If multiple threads access an LinkedHashSet concurrently, 
     and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, 
     it will impact on other threads.

     TreeSet
 
   * TreeSet do not store duplicates.
   * TreeSet do not have index.
   * TreeSet do not support to store null values (not even one null).
     if you try to add null value then JVM throws NullPointerException 
  
   * TreeSet do not preserve insertion order.
   * TreeSet do not allow heterogeneous data.
   
   * Underlying DS of TreeSet is Binary Search Tree and data
     is retrieved using in-order technique.(LEFT-PARENT-RIGHT) 
     
         Constructors of TreeSet
     
    TreeSet()
    Constructs a new, empty tree set, 
    sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements.
    
    TreeSet(Comparator comparator)
    Constructs a new, empty tree set, 
    sorted according to the specified comparator.
    
    TreeSet(Collection c)
    Constructs a new tree set containing the 
    elements in the specified collection, 
    sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements.
    
   
    * Only Objects of those classes which are 
      implementing Comparable Interface
      and Overriding compareTo() can be added to TreeSet.
 
    * If you create a TreeSet object by using TreeSet() then
      elements sorted according to the natural ordering depending
      on compareTo() present in the class.
      
    * If you create a TreeSet object by using TreeSet(Comparator comp) then
      elements sorted according to the customized ordering depending
      on compare() present in the programmer define class.
 
     Comparable interface:
    
    * Comparable interface is used to provide Natural Sorting Order for 
      the object.
    
    * An Object is said to comparable if the class implements Comparable
      interface and overrides compareTo().
      
      
     Comparator Interface
     
     * Comparator Interface is used to provide Customized Sorting Order
       for the Object.
       
     * To use Comparator Interface we have to follow 4 steps
       
       - Create a class that Implements Comparator Interface.
       - Override compare() and specify your customized logic
         to sort the objects.
       - Create the implementation class Object.
       - Pass implementation class Object's reference to the
         constructor of TreeSet.
